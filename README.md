## Insight and recommendation

### _Insight_

- Three of the top five profitable products were office supplies category.

- None of the top 5 loss products are in the office supplies category.

- Office supplies make up 57% of the three product categories that were ordered (technology, furniture, and office supplies).
Therefore, throughout the sales period for which this study was conducted, office supplies received the most orders.
